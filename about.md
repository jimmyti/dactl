ðŸ‘‹ _Hello_ and thanks for stopping by!

I am **Jimmy Ti**, co-founder and technical lead at [Eat More Pixels](http://eatmorepixels.com.au/), a mobile app development studio in Brisbane. Eat More Pixels strives to craft apps with thoughtful usability, delightful user experience and playful design.

I hold a Software Engineering honours degree, and earned PhD for my research in mobile interaction design for public transport social networks. I have been developing iOS apps since 2010 and has developed for clients such as the Heart Foundation, Queensland Museum, and Australian Museum. 

Hope you enjoy the apps that I have made and the writing on this site.
